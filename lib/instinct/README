* What is Instinct? *

Instinct is a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework for Java. Inspired
by RSpec, Instinct provides flexible annotation of contexts, specifications
and actors; automatic creation of test doubles and test subjects; a state and
behaviour expectation API; JUnit test runner integration; Ant support and an
IntelliJ IDEA plugin.


* Distribution Contents *

The distribution contains the following contents:

o README                            - This readme file.
o LICENCE                           - Instinct licence file.
o NOTICE                            - Licence notices for libraries used in Instinct.
o RELEASE-NOTES                     - Release notes for this & previous releases.
o instinct-<version>.jar            - Instinct Jar file.
o instinct-<version>-sources.jar    - Instinct source code.
o instinct-<version>-javadoc.jar    - Instinct API javadoc (does not include internal API).
o lib/                              - Libraries required by Instinct at runtime (including
                                      licences), see below for details.

Instinct depends on the following libraries at runtime.

o cglib-nodep-2.2.jar
o hamcrest-all-1.1.jar
o jmock-2.5.0.jar
o jmock-legacy-2.5.0.jar
o objenesis-1.1.jar
o functionaljava-2.10.jar

In addition, to use the Instinct Ant task, you'll need:

o ant-1.7.1.jar

In addition, to use the JUnit 3/4 runners, you'll need:

o junit-dep-4.4.jar

Note. As JUnit 4.4 bundles Hamcrest, you can choose to either take Hamcrest from JUnit
or as a seperate Jar. If you choose to take the JUnit version you will need the full
JUnit Jar 'junit-4.4.jar' instead of the no dependencies version listed here.

In addition, if you want to use Instinct from Scala, you'll need:

o scala-compiler-2.7.1.r15611-b20080728010100.jar
o scala-library-2.7.1.r15611-b20080728010100.jar

Note. The version of Scala required is newer than the latest released version (2.7.1).
This is due to a known issue in the compiler that has been fixed in the trunk. The
version in lib/scala and used in the example project will work, as will 2.7.2 when
released.

* Package Structure *

Instinct is organised into published APIs and internal packages. You should use
the published API when using Instinct. However, you are welcome to use the
internal classes, though relying on the internal APIs is not advised as they
will change from release to release.


Published packages

com.googlecode.instinct.actor
  Utilities for creating specification actors; dummies, stubs and mocks.

com.googlecode.instinct.expect
  Expectation API -Includes support for setting state & behaviour expectations.

com.googlecode.instinct.integrate
  Integration with other tools such as JUnit and Ant.

com.googlecode.instinct.marker
  Annotations and naming conventions for making code available to Instinct.


Internal packages

com.googlecode.instinct.internal
  All classes in this package are internal Instinct APIs. Relying on them is not
  recommended, they will change.

com.googlecode.instinct.sandbox
  New ideas, not ready for production usage. You are strongly advised not to
  use this code.


Plug-in Points

com.googlecode.instinct.report
  Context result reporting.

com.googlecode.instinct.runner
  Context runners for running Instinct contexts outside of the provided Ant,
  JUnit or IDE runners. e.g. For integration with Spring integration tests.

Thanks to the work done on RSpec, jMock, EasyMock, Boost & JRDF. These libraries
inspired Instinct. Thanks also to the EasyDoc team, past & present, your work is
inspirational.

Some of the work in Instinct is inspired by the research of Tony Morris.
